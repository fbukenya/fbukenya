subtitle: On the promise to protect this calm space

Let’s be clear from the start: this blog sometimes uses affiliate links.  
That means if you click on a link and buy something, I may earn a small commission. It costs you nothing extra, and it helps keep this odd little digital experiment alive.

I want to be transparent about how this works because, frankly, I dislike the feeling of being “sold to” as much as you probably do. The links you’ll find here are only to products, tools, or books that I personally use, believe in, or think add real value to the kind of work and thinking we explore on *My Digital Schrödinger’s Cat*. No algorithmic keyword bait, no random gadgets, no hollow tech hype.

## Why There Are No Ads Here

You’ll never see intrusive ads on this site — no blinking banners, no autoplay videos, no pop-ups begging for your attention.  
I’d rather this space remain clean, quiet, and intentional. This blog is a passion project built in the cracks between focus and fatigue, a digital garden grown slowly, without external noise.  

Running servers, domain renewals, and writing time all cost something, though. So if you ever want to help keep the lights on, there are a few ways:

- **Buy through affiliate links** — they give me a small percentage at no extra cost to you. Simply head to ["Stuff I use"](/stuffiuse) 

- **Donate via Ko-fi**: <script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support me on Ko-fi', '#72a4f2', 'H2H11MW5K5');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>  

- **Send crypto** if you prefer that route:  
  
  - **Bitcoin:** `bc1qzrtk2yt4wzja5y5896lcs2yxw5vpaflw0fjyc3`

  - **Ethereum:** `0x77ae4B0248D9b414BaC4Da2B364c93C168bD82A9` 

Think of it as a tip jar for words — or the digital equivalent of dropping a coin in the open guitar case of someone trying to play something honest.

## The Digital Pan-Handling Truth

Yes, in a way, it’s digital pan-handling. But it’s the kind that tries to give something meaningful back.  
Every essay here takes time, research, and a bit of soul. My hope is that you find value, resonance, or just a small sense of connection in the writing — and if you do, supporting it helps me keep creating without turning this place into a billboard.

There’s no guilt if you never click a single link. Just reading is already part of what sustains it.

Thank you for being here, for reading, and for making this strange corner of the internet feel alive.  
If transparency had a soundtrack, it’d be a quiet acoustic guitar playing in the background while I awkwardly nod and say:  
*“Yeah, this is how the lights stay on.”*
