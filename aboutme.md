subtitle: On this form of Identity

I'm a recovering tech professional existing somewhere between burnout and breakthrough, navigating life with ADHD and an unreasonable amount of caffeine. After years of building web applications while my own operating system ran on duct tape and determination, I'm exploring what happens when you stop forcing outcomes and start working with your brain's natural chaos instead of against it.

This digital garden is where I write about technology, creativity, recovery, and the ongoing experiment of being human in a digital age without completely losing it. Part technical reflection, part philosophical wandering, part ADHD-fueled pattern recognition that occasionally makes sense.

Currently in my Schrodinger's cat era: neither fully in tech nor fully out, finding meaning in the superposition rather than rushing to collapse into a single state. I've been making music longer than I've been writing code, and I'm learning that the best things happen when you stop optimizing for metrics and start optimizing for genuine connection.

Fair warning: I publish in seasons, not schedules. Sometimes daily bursts, sometimes radio silence. It's not inconsistencyâ€”it's honesty about how ADHD attention actually works.
