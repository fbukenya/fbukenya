# Support the Project

This blog isn’t a business. It’s a strange little side-universe built out of curiosity, burnout recovery, and a compulsion to make sense of things through writing.  
There are no ads, no sponsors, and no brand partnerships hiding behind the curtains — just one human trying to write honestly about what it means to stay human in a digital age.

Keeping this space alive — servers, hosting, coffee, and sanity — costs a bit of money and time.  
If the writing here has ever helped, resonated, or simply made you feel a little less alone, there are a few ways you can help keep it going.

## ☕ Buy Me a Coffee (Ko-fi)

The simplest way to say thanks or keep the lights on is through Ko-fi.  
 <script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support me on Ko-fi', '#72a4f2', 'H2H11MW5K5');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>  

Think of it as dropping a quiet “cheers” into the virtual tip jar — a small gesture that says, “keep writing, this matters.”

## ₿ Crypto Support

If you prefer the decentralised route:

- **Bitcoin:** `bc1qzrtk2yt4wzja5y5896lcs2yxw5vpaflw0fjyc3`  

- **Ethereum:** `0x77ae4B0248D9b414BaC4Da2B364c93C168bD82A9`  

Crypto tips go directly toward hosting costs, storage space, and the occasional late-night takeaway that fuels these long-form essays.

## 🛒 Support Through Affiliate Links

Some posts include affiliate links — usually to books, tools, or projects that genuinely align with the spirit of the blog. You can find a simple list (this will be a living document so it will grow over time). You can find the list at ["Stuff I use"](/stuffiuse). 


Buying through them costs you nothing extra, but sends a few quiet cents my way.  
It’s the digital equivalent of tossing a coin into the hat of a street musician whose song caught you off guard.

For the full explanation, see the [Affiliate Disclosure](/affiliate) page.

## Why This Matters

I made a decision early on: no ads. Ever.  
No pop-ups, no tracking scripts, no dopamine traps.  
If this blog grows, it’ll grow slowly, like a garden — tended by curiosity and the occasional kind stranger.

Supporting the project helps me spend more time writing and less time fighting algorithms. It also means I can keep exploring topics that don’t always “perform” well but still feel important: attention, burnout, AI, creativity, compassion, and the beautiful absurdity of existing at all.

## If You Can’t Donate

That’s completely fine.  
Seriously.  
Reading, sharing, or just being here already means more than it looks like on paper.  
Every view, every message, every quiet nod from a reader who gets it — it all helps.

So if you’ve ever thought, “this post hit a little too close to home,” you’ve already given back in the best possible way.

Thank you for keeping this weird, fragile thing alive.  
It’s not about profit. It’s about persistence.  
A small light on the internet, flickering but still burning — powered by curiosity, kindness, and the generosity of strangers.
